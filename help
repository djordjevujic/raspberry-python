Testing ports

Listing ports
python -m serial.tools.list_ports will print a list of available ports. 
It is also possible to add a regexp as first argument and the list will 
only include entries that matched.

Note The enumeration may not work on all operating systems. It may be incomplete,
list unavailable ports or may lack detailed descriptions of the ports.

Accessing portsÂ¶
pySerial includes a small console based terminal program called serial.tools.miniterm. 
It ca be started with python -m serial.tools.miniterm <port_name>
(use option -h to get a listing of all options).
